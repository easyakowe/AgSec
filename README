This android application details the operation of a informative system for small-holder farmers in Nigeria. Basic crop cultivation information is provided, tips, agro-agencies and other farming information.
The app also has a medium where farmers can communicate with consultants/professionals, sharing farming issues to these specialists and get feedback.
It also incorporates a prediction algorithm where farmers can input their location and then get the level of susceptibility of their farmlands to attacks by fulani herdsmen.
